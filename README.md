# auto-clicker
the autoclicker.exe file will not work by itself and you will need to use the installer to get it
but for the installer you also need these 3 files that are in the installer folder

libgcc_s_seh-1.dll
libstdc++-6.dll
libwinpthread-1.dll

all these dll files will need to be in the same folder as the installer for the installer to work
